# Hello-World
This is my first repository
My name is Devrett Gupta and I am a senior in the business program at Cascade OSU. I am a day trader in the futures market (Nasdaq E-mini). I am a bassist in two Bend Oregon folk bands called Bony Chanterelle and The Chinups. Here is a link to Bony Chanterelle's band camp page so you can listen to our sound https://bonychanterelle.bandcamp.com/ I am also a competitive snowboarder and compete in boardercross, slopestyle, halfpipe, and many other events. I am sponsored by Donek Snowboards. I am also a mountain bike coach for MBSEF here in Bend Oregon.
